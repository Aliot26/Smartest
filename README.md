| Java – Spring – Angular - Hibernate – Junit – SQL - MVC |
Implementation of application to manage an environmentally-friendly

sunshades on windows or watering the garden. It is also possible to
distribute supplies between apartments to optimize the use of it for
the estate as a whole structure. Frontend created with use Angular
