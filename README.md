Implementation of application to manage an environmentally-friendly
estate. Invented and designed independently with my team partner.

power from solar panels and wind turbines, water from rain,
sunshades on windows or watering the garden. It is also possible to
distribute supplies between apartments to optimize the use of it for
the estate as a whole structure. Frontend created with use Angular
